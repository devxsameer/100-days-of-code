## 🔍 Theme: More Testing & Clean Code

---

## ✅ What I Learned / Did

- Completed The Odin Project’s **More Testing** lesson. 
- Explored **isolation in tests** — ensuring one function’s tests don’t depend on another’s behavior.
- Learned about **tightly coupled code** and why it’s harder to test.
- Understood **pure functions** — functions that, given the same input, always return the same output and have no side effects.
- Studied **mocking**: how to create fake implementations of dependencies so you can test units in isolation. 

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Tests should be **isolated** — don’t rely on external functions unless absolutely necessary.  
- Writing **pure functions** improves testability and code clarity.  
- **Mocking** is a tool to get around external dependencies when you can’t fully decouple code.  
- Overusing mocks is a red flag — if you need to mock *everything*, your architecture might be too tightly coupled.

## 📈 Reflection

This lesson was less about writing new features and more about writing better, cleaner, more testable code.  
It pushed me to think about how I structure logic so that each part is independently verifiable.
