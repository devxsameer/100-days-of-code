## Day 57: Revision Day 🔄

### 🔎 Theme of the Day

Light session focused on revising previously learned concepts.

---

### ✅ What I Worked On:

- Went over recent topics like **linters, formatters, OOP principles, and SOLID**.
- Consolidated understanding instead of adding new material.

---

### 📌 Notes:

- Sometimes slowing down and revisiting past lessons helps more than rushing ahead.
- Reinforcement > forgetting later.

📅 **Progress:** Day 57/100 complete!
