# 📅 Day 27 - #100DaysOfCode

Today I focused on practicing **typography and text styling** in CSS — an essential part of building beautiful and readable interfaces. 🎨🖋️

---

## ✅ What I Did

- Chose a well-designed **typographic paragraph** as inspiration
- Recreated the **layout, font styling, spacing, and alignment** using custom CSS
- Focused on details like:
  - `font-family`, `font-weight`, and `line-height`
  - `letter-spacing`, `word-spacing`, and `text-align`
  - Padding, margin, and overall readability

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Typography isn’t just about fonts — it’s about **visual rhythm** and **user experience**
- Even simple paragraphs can look elegant with proper CSS
- Practicing by copying good designs sharpens your eye for detail

Typography is subtle, but it’s powerful — and today’s hands-on practice was both fun and rewarding! 💪
