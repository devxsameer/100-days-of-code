# Day 71 â€“ #100DaysOfCode  

### ðŸ“Œ Summary  
Today I completed the **Linked List Project** from The Odin Project!  
Not only did I implement all the required methods, but I also tackled the **extra credit challenges** and pushed everything to a clean GitHub repo.  

### ðŸš€ What I Did  
- Implemented a **singly linked list** in JavaScript  
- Added methods: append, prepend, size, head, tail, at, pop, contains, find, toString  
- Completed **extra credit**: insertAt, removeAt  
- Cleaned up the repo and pushed to GitHub  

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Learnings  
- Deeper understanding of **nodes & pointers**  
- Practiced **insertion, deletion, and traversal** operations  
- Saw how linked lists differ from arrays in efficiency  
- Strengthened problem-solving and debugging skills  

Onward to the next data structure! ðŸš€
