# 📅 Day 25 - #100DaysOfCode

Today was all about mastering the art of **text and typography** using CSS — continuing my journey through the **Full Stack JavaScript Path** on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). ✍️

## ✅ What I Did

- 🖋️ Learned advanced **text styling techniques** in CSS  
- 🔤 Explored how to use `@font-face` to load **custom fonts** locally  
- 🌐 Integrated **external fonts** from Google Fonts  
- 🔁 Learned about **font fallback stacks** for reliability across devices  
- ✨ Practiced various **text properties**, including:
  - `letter-spacing`, `word-spacing`
  - `line-height`, `text-transform`
  - `text-align`, `text-decoration`, `text-shadow`, etc.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Custom fonts can enhance the personality of a design — but fallback fonts are essential for robustness  
- `@font-face` gives full control over font loading and usage  
- Proper text styling improves both **readability** and **aesthetics**

Typography is where design meets code — and it’s fun to get creative while keeping it accessible! 🎨💻
