# Day 69 - #100DaysOfCode

**Quick Summary:**  
Dipped my toes into **Computer Science fundamentals** today — a crash course in algorithms, data structures, and recursion. Spoiler: recursion is like Inception, but with functions. 🌀

---

## 📘 What I Did Today
- Got a **brief introduction to CS concepts** through The Odin Project.  
- Learned about **algorithms** and **data structures** — the building blocks of efficient code.  
- Focused heavily on **recursion**, practicing different problems to get a solid grasp.  

---

## 🔑 Key Takeaways
- Algorithms are step-by-step problem-solving recipes.  
- Data structures are how we **organize information** to make algorithms efficient.  
- Recursion helps break big problems into smaller, repeated ones — as long as you remember the base case (or you fall into infinite function limbo 🕳️).

✅ Closing Day 69 with a good foundation in core CS principles and a new appreciation for recursion magic.
