## 💼 Project: **DevProfile**

**DevProfile** is a sleek, interactive resume builder built with **React 19**, **Vite 7**, and **Tailwind CSS 4**.  
It allows users to **create, edit, and preview resumes in real time**, focusing on elegant design, state management, and responsive layout — no formatting struggles, just professional results.

- 📱 **Responsive Design** — Optimized layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.
- 🧠 **State Management** — Used React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for dynamic updates.
