### ðŸ“… Day 43â€“44 â€“ Tic Tac Toe: Built with IIFE, Modules & PubSub

Over the last two days, I built a fully functional **Tic Tac Toe game** as part of The Odin Project â€” and made sure to architect it with clean, scalable, modular JavaScript.

## âœ… What I Built

ðŸŽ® **Tic Tac Toe**  
ðŸ”— [Live Demo](https://devxsameer.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/devxsameer/tic-tac-toe)

### Key Features:
- Modular structure using **IIFEs** and the **Module Pattern**
- **No global variables** â€” everything is neatly scoped  
- Created a custom **Publishâ€“Subscribe (PubSub)** system to manage events  
- Clean, user-friendly UI with dynamic feedback  
- Win/draw detection, turn indicators, and restart functionality

---

## ðŸ§  What I Practiced

- Writing scoped modules with **IIFEs**  
- Using **factory functions** and prototypes where needed  
- Creating and wiring up a **PubSub module** for decoupled logic  
- DOM manipulation and state handling in real-time  
- Keeping logic and UI separate for easier maintenance

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Takeaway

This project helped solidify how to build interactive apps with **modular architecture** and custom event handling â€” all while keeping the global scope squeaky clean.

Onward to the next challenge!
