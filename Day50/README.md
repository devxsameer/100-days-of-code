## Day 50: JSON & OOP Principles 📦💡

### ✅ What I Worked On:
- Continued The Odin Project curriculum.
- Learned the basics of **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation):
  - Structure and syntax
  - How to parse and stringify JSON data
  - Practical uses in web applications
- Studied **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** in JavaScript:
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
- Understood how these principles help write cleaner, reusable, and maintainable code.

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- JSON is basically the “universal translator” for data between different systems.
- `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` are my new best friends for handling API data.
- OOP makes large codebases easier to manage by grouping related data and behavior together.
- How to create and use objects in a structured, modular way in JavaScript.

---

### 📌 Notes:
- JSON is *language-independent* — can be used with JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.
- OOP is not just for big apps — even small projects benefit from its organization.

---

### 🚀 Next Steps:
- Apply JSON handling in small API-based projects.
- Practice OOP concepts by refactoring older JavaScript code into object-oriented structure.
- Move forward with the next Odin Project lessons.
