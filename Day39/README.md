### 📅 Day 39 – Review, Reflect, Reinforce 🔁

Today was a revision-focused day — I went over everything I’ve worked on in the past several days to solidify the concepts before moving forward.

---

## ✅ What I Reviewed

- 🧱 JavaScript **object constructors** & **prototypes**
- 📚 Logic & structure of my recent **LibraryX** project
- 💡 DOM manipulation, event handling, and layout design

---

## 🔁 Why It Mattered

- Helped reinforce the "why" behind how I built LibraryX  
- Clarified the difference between prototype methods and instance properties  
- Refreshed syntax and flow before starting the next challenge

---

Some days are about writing code.  
Others are about understanding the code you've already written.
