# 📅 Day 72 — #100DaysOfCode

**Theme:** Cracking the code of HashMaps & HashSets 🗂️

---

## 🔹 Quick Summary

Today I went deep into **hashing** and completed the **HashMap & HashSet implementation project** from The Odin Project.  
From hashing functions to collisions, resizing, and ensuring uniqueness — I now have a solid grasp of how these data structures work under the hood.

## 🛠 What I Did

- Implemented a **HashMap** in JavaScript with:
  - `set`, `get`, `has`, `remove`, `clear`, `keys`, `values`, `entries`
  - Automatic **resizing** when the load factor exceeded `0.75`
- Built a **HashSet** that ensures unique values with:
  - `add`, `has`, `remove`, `clear`, `values`
- Added demo usage to test all methods.
- Documented the project with a detailed README.

## 📚 Key Takeaways

- Hashing provides **fast lookups and insertions (avg O(1))**, but handling **collisions** is critical.  
- **Load factor** determines efficiency — resizing and rehashing keep performance optimal.  
- A **HashSet** is essentially a specialized HashMap with uniqueness guaranteed.  
- Implementing these from scratch really strengthened my grasp of **data structures** and **memory management concepts**.

## 🚀 Outcomes

- ✅ Completed both HashMap & HashSet implementations.  
- ✅ Pushed to GitHub with clean documentation.  
- ✅ One more solid CS concept mastered — ready for bigger challenges ahead.
