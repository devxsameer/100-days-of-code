## Day 60: Async JavaScript, Event Loop & Babel âš¡

### ðŸ”Ž Theme of the Day
Deep dive into JavaScriptâ€™s async behavior, browser internals, and modern tooling.

---

### âœ… What I Learned
- **Async JavaScript Concepts**
  - Callbacks & the infamous *callback hell* ðŸ˜…
  - Microtask Queue vs. Macrotask Queue
  - Browser APIs & how the **Event Loop** actually works
  - Promises and cleaner async handling

- **JavaScript Evolution**
  - JavaScript versioning system
  - Where **ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)** fits in modern JS

- **Tooling**
  - What **Babel** does (transpiling modern JS â†’ backwards-compatible JS)

- **Practical Application**
  - Refactored and added **form handling** in my **LibraryX project**
  - Improved code clarity and structure

---

### ðŸ§  Notes & Takeaways
- The event loop is the unsung hero behind async behavior â€” understanding it makes debugging async issues much easier.  
- ES6 gave us cleaner syntax (e.g., `let`, `const`, arrow functions, classes, promises), and Babel ensures it runs everywhere.  
- Refactoring real projects with new knowledge is the best way to learn.

ðŸ“… **Progress:** Day 60/100 complete â€” async world feels a lot less magical now âœ¨
