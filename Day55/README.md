## Day 55: Revisiting SOLID Principles & Loose Coupling 🏗️

### 🔎 Theme of the Day

A light day focused on revising some core software design principles — mainly **SOLID** and **loose coupling**.

---

### ✅ What I Worked On:

- Revised **SOLID principles** and their role in writing clean, scalable code.
- Refreshed the importance of **loose coupling** between components for maintainability.
- Reflected on how these principles can improve project architecture long term.

---

### 🧠 What I Learned / Reinforced:

- SOLID isn’t just buzzwords — it genuinely helps keep codebases flexible and less painful to refactor.
- Loose coupling = more independence between modules = fewer headaches when changing code.
- Even small projects benefit from these practices.

---

### 📌 Notes:

- No heavy coding today, just theory and revision.
- Sometimes consolidating knowledge is as important as writing new lines of code.

📅 **Progress:** Day 55/100 complete!
