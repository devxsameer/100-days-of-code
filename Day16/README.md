# 📅 Day 16 - #100DaysOfCode

Today was all about writing better code and understanding core JavaScript concepts more deeply. 🧠💻

## ✅ What I Did

- Continued with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) JavaScript Foundations curriculum
- Learned about:
  - ✨ Writing **clean and readable code**
  - 🔁 **Loops** (for, while) and how they help iterate efficiently
  - 📦 **Arrays** and useful **array methods** like `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`, `splice()`, etc.
  - 🌐 **DOM Manipulation** using `querySelector`, `createElement`, `appendChild`, and more
  - 🖱️ **Event listeners** for adding interactivity to web pages

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Writing **clean code** makes it easier to read, debug, and scale
- Loops and arrays are essential for handling data and repetitive tasks
- JavaScript truly shines when paired with the **DOM** for dynamic interfaces
- Events allow you to make your page come alive with user interaction
