### ðŸ“… Day 46â€“47 â€“ JS Classes, Modules & Build Tool Madness

The last two days were a deep dive into **modern JavaScript architecture** â€” including the mystical realms of **classes**, **modules**, and the toolchains that somehow make it all browser-friendly.

## âœ… What I Learned

- ðŸ§± **JavaScript Classes**
  - Mastered `constructor`, `this`, `extends`, `super`, and `static`  
  - Basically turned JavaScript into diet Java

- ðŸ“¦ **ES Modules (ESM)**
  - `import` and `export` â€” finally, some organization!

- ðŸ§ª **NPM**
  - Learned how to initialize a project, install packages, and still forget to add `--save-dev` out of habit

- ðŸ”§ **Webpack**
  - Built my first config file like a wizard with a manual
  - Explored entry/output, loaders, bundling, and the eternal question: "Why is this build folder 30MB?"

---

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Classes are sugar-coated prototypes â€” but tasty once you get it  
- Modules keep code neat (and broken if you forget curly braces)  
- Webpack is like magic, if magic came with a 15-step setup  
- NPM is how JavaScript makes sure you never work alone

It was two days of few commits, but a ton of config, brain stretch, and realizing how much JavaScript has grown up.
