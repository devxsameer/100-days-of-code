## Day 61: Workflow Setup with Webpack, Babel, Sass & Linters ⚙️🛠️

### 🔎 Theme of the Day

Exploring the modern JavaScript development workflow and how all the moving pieces fit together.

---

### ✅ What I Learned

- **Webpack**: Bundling modules, assets, and setting up dev workflow
- **Babel**: Transpiling modern ES6+ JavaScript into browser-friendly code
- **Sass**: Writing cleaner, more maintainable CSS with variables & nesting
- **ESLint + Prettier**:
  - ESLint for code quality and catching errors
  - Prettier for automatic code formatting
  - How they complement each other in dev setup

---

### 🧠 Notes & Takeaways

- A good **dev setup** saves future headaches — linters/formatters are like spellcheck for code.
- Understanding configs (instead of just copy-pasting them) helps a ton in debugging later.
- Workflow setup may look boring at first, but it’s the backbone of a smoother development experience.
