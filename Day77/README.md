# 🧪 Day 77 — #100DaysOfCode

## Odin Testing Practice ✅

Today I completed the **Testing Practice Project** from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice).

This project was all about building small **JavaScript utility functions** and writing **unit tests with Jest** to practice **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and strengthen debugging skills.

## 🔨 Functions Implemented

- `capitalize(string)` → Capitalizes the first letter.
- `reverseString(string)` → Reverses a string.
- `calculator` → Object with `add`, `subtract`, `divide`, `multiply`.
- `caesarCipher(string, shift)` → Caesar Cipher implementation handling wrap-around, case, negatives, and non-alphabetic chars.
- `analyzeArray(array)` → Returns `{ average, min, max, length }`.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **Jest** for testing
- **Babel** for ES6 import/export support

---

## 📖 Key Learnings

- Practiced **unit testing** with proper structure (`describe` + `test`).
- Strengthened **TDD mindset** by writing tests before implementation.
- Handled edge cases:
  - Empty strings
  - Empty arrays
  - Division by zero
  - Negative Caesar Cipher shifts
