# 📅 Day 26 - #100DaysOfCode

Another productive day of learning and applying **advanced CSS techniques** while continuing progress in **CS50P**! 🚀

## ✅ What I Did

🎨 **Advanced CSS Topics (The Odin Project - Full Stack JS Path):**
- Explored **overflow** behavior and how to control it  
- Mastered **background shorthand** properties  
- Practiced **advanced CSS selectors**: child, sibling, attribute, and pseudo-selectors  
- Learned how to work with **opacity** and **box shadows** effectively  
- Styled borders with more **precision and variation**  
- Studied **CSS positioning**: `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky`

🐍 **CS50P Progress:**
- Submitted **Problem Set 2**  
- Strengthened understanding of **functions**, **conditionals**, and **code structure** in Python

## 💡 Key Takeaways
