### 📅 Day 41 – The Module Pattern & Factory Inheritance

Today I explored the **Module Pattern** in JavaScript — a powerful way to write organized, encapsulated code — along with some important concepts that build on what I’ve learned recently.

---

## ✅ What I Learned

- 🧩 **Module Pattern** using IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)
- 🔒 Creating **private variables and functions** via closures
- 🧪 Combining **factory functions** with **prototypal inheritance**
- 🔁 Revisited closures, scope, and object creation for clarity

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Modules help keep code clean and self-contained  
- Closures are the backbone of private state in JavaScript  
- Factories + Prototypes = scalable, memory-efficient object logic

---

All of this is setting the stage for more structured and reusable code in future projects.
