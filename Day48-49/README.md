## Days 48–49: Byte and Dine 🍝 (The Odin Project)

### ✅ What I Worked On:

- Started and completed the **Restaurant Page** project from The Odin Project.
- Project Name: **Byte and Dine**
- Set up **Webpack** and configured loaders, plugins, and `webpack-dev-server`.
- Practiced using **npm**, scripts, and local development environment setup.
- Used **JavaScript ES6 modules** to dynamically render pages: `Home`, `Menu`, and `About`.
- Modularized content and used DOM manipulation to update the page based on navigation.
- Learned how to bundle and build the app using `npm run build`.

### 🧠 What I Learned:

- How to configure and use **Webpack** from scratch.
- Organizing JS files into reusable, maintainable **modules**.
- Setting up scripts for development (`npm run dev`) and production builds.
- Working with **webpack-dev-server** to auto-refresh during development.
- Basic structure of a multipage frontend project — without a framework.

📌 This project took me two focused days, and I now feel more confident in setting up modern dev environments for JS projects!
