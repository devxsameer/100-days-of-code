# 📅 Day 30 - #100DaysOfCode

🎉 30 days in — and today I stepped into the **beautiful chaos of CSS Grid**!

---

## ✅ What I Did

- 🔁 Did a quick **revision** of key HTML/CSS topics
- 🎯 Started learning **CSS Grid layout system**, including:
  - Basic grid terminology (rows, columns, tracks, gaps, areas)
  - `grid-template-rows` & `grid-template-columns`
  - `gap`, `row-gap`, `column-gap`
  - `grid-auto-rows` & `grid-auto-columns`

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- **Grid** is like Flexbox’s older, more structured sibling — perfect for 2D layouts
- `gap` is the MVP of spacing — no more margin hacks
- The grid auto features are mind-blowingly helpful for dynamic content

---

## 🔜 What's Next?

- Practice placing grid items using line numbers and `grid-area`
- Start small layout projects using pure Grid
- Maybe... a dashboard? 👀

---

It's been 30 days of learning, and today’s dive into Grid feels like unlocking a secret level in CSS 🧩
