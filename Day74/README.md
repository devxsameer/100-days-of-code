## 🐙 Git Deep Dive (via The Odin Project)  
Today I put my data structures on pause and went spelunking into the world of **Git**.  
- Learned about some **powerful (and slightly scary) commands**:  
  - 🔄 `git rebase` – rewriting history like a time traveler  
  - 🗑️ `git reset` – undoing commits (carefully!)  
  - 📌 `git reflog` – the "black box recorder" for when things go wrong  
- Explored how to clean up commit history and keep branches neat.  
- Practiced workflows that make collaboration smoother and repos tidier.

## 🎯 Key Learnings  
- Git is more than just `git add . && git commit -m "done"`.  
- **Rebase** is amazing for history cleanup — but also a loaded gun 🔫.  
- **Reset** can rescue or wreck, depending on how you use it.  
- Understanding how Git tracks everything under the hood makes debugging much easier.

## 💡 Reflection  
Today felt less about writing code and more about **becoming a better developer teammate**.  
Knowing Git deeply = fewer mistakes + cleaner projects + actual confidence when things go wrong.
