# 📅 Day 84 — #100DaysOfCode

## 🌐 Theme: Web Accessibility & CS50 Python PSet4

---

## ✅ What I Learned / Did

- Completed all lessons in The Odin Project’s **Accessibility** section (under Advanced HTML & CSS)

  - Covered semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, WAI-ARIA attributes, accessible colors, and contrast ratios.
  - Learned how to audit webpages for accessibility and adhere to WCAG principles (POUR: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust).
  - Practiced making sites more usable for people with disabilities and situational limitations.

- Solved **CS50P Problem Set 4** (Week 4 of CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python)

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Accessibility is not optional — it's essential for inclusive user experience.
- Using semantic HTML and ARIA properly helps assistive technologies interpret your content.
- WCAG guidelines are a useful reference for designing accessible interfaces.
- In CS50P PSet4, combining knowledge of Python with precision and testing is key to passing automated checks.
- Balancing front-end (accessibility) and algorithmic practice (CS50P) helps develop both user-facing and backend thinking.

## 📈 Reflection

Today felt like building bridges: between users & interfaces (accessibility) and between theory & practice (CS50P).  
Sometimes growth is about polishing skills rather than starting something brand new — and finishing two big curricula parts in one day feels
