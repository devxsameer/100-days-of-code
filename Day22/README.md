# ðŸ“… Day 22 - #100DaysOfCode

After a break of over two weeks due to laptop issues, college assignments, and life in general â€” Iâ€™m back on track with my #100DaysOfCode journey! ðŸ”¥

## âœ… What I Did Today

- ðŸ“˜ Submitted **Problem Set 0** for **Week 0 of CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P)**  
- ðŸš€ Picked up where I left off on **The Odin Projectâ€™s Full Stack JavaScript Path**  
- âœ¨ Learned and practiced **Emmet** â€“ a powerful toolkit for writing HTML & CSS faster

---

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Emmet speeds up writing repetitive code like a pro  
- Completing the first CS50P problem set gave me a good refresh on logic and precision  
- It feels great to return to consistent learning and coding again!

## ðŸ”œ What's Next?

- Continue with CS50P Week 1: learning about conditionals, loops, and variables in Python  
- Progress through the early sections of the Full Stack JavaScript path
