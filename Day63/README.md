# Day 63 - #100DaysOfCode

**Quick Summary:**  
Promises polished, API doors unlocked, and async/await just entered the chat. ðŸšªâœ¨

---

## What I Did Today
- Revised **JavaScript Promises** and refreshed my understanding of how `.then()` and `.catch()` work.  
- Took the first step into the world of **APIs** â€” learning how they act as bridges for data exchange.  
- Got introduced to **async/await**, a cleaner way to write asynchronous code compared to promise chaining.  

---

## Key Takeaways
- Promises help tame asynchronous code but can get messy with chaining.  
- APIs are essentially communication channels between apps/services.  
- `async/await` makes async code feel synchronous, improving readability.

âœ… Slow but steady â€” async world, here I come!
