# 📙 Days 61–100 of #100DaysOfCode

The final stretch!  
Here I focus on building larger projects, polishing skills, and possibly crying over edge cases. Expect more polish, real-world logic.

Let’s bring it home strong! 💪🎯

<summary><strong>Day 63 - [1 September 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Promises polished, API doors unlocked, and async/await just entered the chat. 🚪✨

**What I Did:**

- Revised **JavaScript Promises** and refreshed my understanding of how `.then()` and `.catch()` work.
- Took the first step into the world of **APIs** — learning how they act as bridges for data exchange.

<summary><strong>Day 64 - [2 September 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Async/await leveled up, APIs unlocked — now coding with GIFs and weather vibes. 🌦️😂

**What I Did:**

- Dived deeper into **async/await** — really understood how it simplifies working with asynchronous code.
- Started working with **APIs** in practice.
  - Played around with the **Giphy API** to fetch and display GIFs.
  - Experimented with the **Visual Crossing Weather API** to pull real-time weather data.

✅ From GIFs to forecasts — async/await makes the future look bright _and_ funny.

<summary><strong>Day 65-68 - [12-15 September 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** From data to design — building **Zephyr**, a modern weather app 🌤️

**What I Did:**

Over four days, I built **Zephyr**, a responsive weather app powered by **Open-Meteo APIs** and **WeatherAPI.com**. It provides **real-time weather**, a **5-day forecast**, sunrise/sunset times, wind/humidity/UV highlights, and a clean hero section with background states. Built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript**, **Webpack**, and **date-fns**, with modular ES modules, error states, and unit toggling.

<summary><strong>Day 69 - [16 September 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Dipped my toes into **Computer Science fundamentals** today — a crash course in algorithms, data structures, and recursion. Spoiler: recursion is like Inception, but with functions. 🌀

**What I Did:**

- Got a **brief introduction to CS concepts** through The Odin Project.
- Learned about **algorithms** and **data structures** — the building blocks of efficient code.
- Focused heavily on **recursion**, practicing different problems to get a solid grasp.

✅ Closing Day 69 with a good foundation in core CS principles and a new appreciation for recursion magic.

<details>
<summary><strong>Day 70 - [17 September 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Wrapped up the recursion project and spent today diving into **time complexity, space complexity, and Big O notation** — the real tools for measuring algorithm efficiency.

**What I Did:**

- ✅ Finished the **Recursion Project** (Fibonacci & Merge Sort).
- 📚 Studied **time complexity** (how fast algorithms grow with input size).
- 📚 Studied **space complexity** (how much memory algorithms consume).
- 🔍 Explored **Big O notation** in detail.
- Briefly touched on asymptotic notations (**Ω**, **Θ**) but main focus was on Big O.

<summary><strong>Day 71 - [18 September 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today I completed the **Linked List Project** from The Odin Project!  
Not only did I implement all the required methods, but I also tackled the **extra credit challenges** and pushed everything to a clean GitHub repo.

**What I Did:**

- Implemented a **singly linked list** in JavaScript
- Added methods: append, prepend, size, head, tail, at, pop, contains, find, toString
- Completed **extra credit**: insertAt, removeAt
- Cleaned up the repo and pushed to GitHub

<summary><strong>Day 72 - [19 September 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Cracking the code of HashMaps & HashSets 🗂️

**What I Did:**

- Implemented a **HashMap** in JavaScript with:
  - `set`, `get`, `has`, `remove`, `clear`, `keys`, `values`, `entries`
  - Automatic **resizing** when the load factor exceeded `0.75`
- Built a **HashSet** that ensures unique values with:
  - `add`, `has`, `remove`, `clear`, `values`
- Added demo usage to test all methods.
- Documented the project with a detailed README.

**What I Learnt:**

- Git is more than just `git add . && git commit -m "done"`.
- **Rebase** is amazing for history cleanup — but also a loaded gun 🔫.
- **Reset** can rescue or wreck, depending on how you use it.
- Understanding how Git tracks everything under the hood makes debugging much easier.

  • Proper workflows for collaborating via GitHub: forks, feature branches, pull requests.  
  • What makes a good commit message and how it helps when working with other developers or open source.

**What I Did/Learned:**

- What TDD is: writing tests _before_ writing the code to satisfy them.
- Set up Jest and ran basic test suites.
- Explored Jest matchers (e.g. `toEqual`, `toBe`, etc.) and how to assert behavior.
- Reflected on benefits of TDD: better code design, fewer bugs, more confidence making changes.

**What I Did/Learned:**

- Practiced **unit testing** with proper structure (`describe` + `test`).
- Strengthened **TDD mindset** by writing tests before implementation.
- Handled edge cases:
  - Empty strings
  - Empty arrays
  - Division by zero
  - Negative Caesar Cipher shifts

<summary><strong>Day 78 - [26 September 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** More Testing & Clean Code

**What I Did/Learned:**

- Completed The Odin Project’s **More Testing** lesson.
- Explored **isolation in tests** — ensuring one function’s tests don’t depend on another’s behavior.
- Learned about **tightly coupled code** and why it’s harder to test.
- Understood **pure functions** — functions that, given the same input, always return the same output and have no side effects.
- Studied **mocking**: how to create fake implementations of dependencies so you can test units in isolation.
