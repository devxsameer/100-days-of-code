# 📙 Days 61–100 of #100DaysOfCode

The final stretch!  
Here I focus on building larger projects, polishing skills, and possibly crying over edge cases. Expect more polish, real-world logic.

Let’s bring it home strong! 💪🎯

<summary><strong>Day 61 - [24 August 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Exploring the modern JavaScript development workflow and how all the moving pieces fit together.

**What I Learnt:**

- **Webpack**: Bundling modules, assets, and setting up dev workflow
- **Babel**: Transpiling modern ES6+ JavaScript into browser-friendly code
- **Sass**: Writing cleaner, more maintainable CSS with variables & nesting
- **ESLint + Prettier**:
  - ESLint for code quality and catching errors
  - Prettier for automatic code formatting
  - How they complement each other in dev setup

📅 **Progress:** Day 61/100 complete — today was all about the “tools behind the code.” 🔧

<summary><strong>Day 62 - [25 August 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** A quick revision session on **asynchronous JavaScript** (callbacks, promises, event loop, etc.), followed by an important announcement.

**What I Learnt:**

- Revised key async JS concepts for better retention.
- No major coding or project work today.
- Preparing for **IIT Madras BS in Data Science and Applications** end-term exam on **31st August**.

**Break Notice**  
I’ll be taking a short break from **#100DaysOfCode** until **31st August** to focus on exam prep.  
🚀 I’ll resume fresh on **1st September** with more energy and consistency!

📅 **Progress:** Day 62/100 complete — async JS revised, exams ahead, code journey continues soon.

<summary><strong>Day 63 - [1 September 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Promises polished, API doors unlocked, and async/await just entered the chat. 🚪✨

**What I Did:**

- Revised **JavaScript Promises** and refreshed my understanding of how `.then()` and `.catch()` work.
- Took the first step into the world of **APIs** — learning how they act as bridges for data exchange.
- Got introduced to **async/await**, a cleaner way to write asynchronous code compared to promise chaining.

✅ Slow but steady — async world, here I come!

<summary><strong>Day 64 - [2 September 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Async/await leveled up, APIs unlocked — now coding with GIFs and weather vibes. 🌦️😂

**What I Did:**

- Dived deeper into **async/await** — really understood how it simplifies working with asynchronous code.
- Started working with **APIs** in practice.
  - Played around with the **Giphy API** to fetch and display GIFs.
  - Experimented with the **Visual Crossing Weather API** to pull real-time weather data.

✅ From GIFs to forecasts — async/await makes the future look bright _and_ funny.

<summary><strong>Day 65-68 - [12-15 September 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** From data to design — building **Zephyr**, a modern weather app 🌤️

**What I Did:**

Over four days, I built **Zephyr**, a responsive weather app powered by **Open-Meteo APIs** and **WeatherAPI.com**. It provides **real-time weather**, a **5-day forecast**, sunrise/sunset times, wind/humidity/UV highlights, and a clean hero section with background states. Built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript**, **Webpack**, and **date-fns**, with modular ES modules, error states, and unit toggling.

<summary><strong>Day 69 - [16 September 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Dipped my toes into **Computer Science fundamentals** today — a crash course in algorithms, data structures, and recursion. Spoiler: recursion is like Inception, but with functions. 🌀

**What I Did:**

- Got a **brief introduction to CS concepts** through The Odin Project.
- Learned about **algorithms** and **data structures** — the building blocks of efficient code.
- Focused heavily on **recursion**, practicing different problems to get a solid grasp.

✅ Closing Day 69 with a good foundation in core CS principles and a new appreciation for recursion magic.

<summary><strong>Day 70 - [17 September 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Wrapped up the recursion project and spent today diving into **time complexity, space complexity, and Big O notation** — the real tools for measuring algorithm efficiency.

**What I Did:**

- ✅ Finished the **Recursion Project** (Fibonacci & Merge Sort).
- 📚 Studied **time complexity** (how fast algorithms grow with input size).
- 📚 Studied **space complexity** (how much memory algorithms consume).
- 🔍 Explored **Big O notation** in detail.
- Briefly touched on asymptotic notations (**Ω**, **Θ**) but main focus was on Big O.

<summary><strong>Day 71 - [18 September 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today I completed the **Linked List Project** from The Odin Project!  
Not only did I implement all the required methods, but I also tackled the **extra credit challenges** and pushed everything to a clean GitHub repo.

**What I Did:**

- Implemented a **singly linked list** in JavaScript
- Added methods: append, prepend, size, head, tail, at, pop, contains, find, toString
- Completed **extra credit**: insertAt, removeAt
- Cleaned up the repo and pushed to GitHub
