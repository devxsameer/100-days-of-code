# 📙 Days 61–100 of #100DaysOfCode

The final stretch!  
Here I focus on building larger projects, polishing skills, and possibly crying over edge cases. Expect more polish, real-world logic.

Let’s bring it home strong! 💪🎯

<summary><strong>Day 61 - [24 August 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Exploring the modern JavaScript development workflow and how all the moving pieces fit together.

**What I Learnt:**

- **Webpack**: Bundling modules, assets, and setting up dev workflow
- **Babel**: Transpiling modern ES6+ JavaScript into browser-friendly code
- **Sass**: Writing cleaner, more maintainable CSS with variables & nesting
- **ESLint + Prettier**:
  - ESLint for code quality and catching errors
  - Prettier for automatic code formatting
  - How they complement each other in dev setup

📅 **Progress:** Day 61/100 complete — today was all about the “tools behind the code.” 🔧
