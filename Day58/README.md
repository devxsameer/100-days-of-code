## Day 58: CSS & JS Practice + npm Packages 🎨⚙️📦

### 🔎 Theme of the Day
Hands-on practice with frontend interactions and exploring how to share code through npm packages.

---

### ✅ What I Worked On:
- Practiced **CSS** and **JavaScript** basics.  
- Built small UI components:  
  - A **dropdown menu**  
  - An **image carousel**  
- Followed The Odin Project’s exercises to strengthen frontend skills.  
- Learned about the process of **publishing your own npm packages**:
  - Setting up `package.json` properly  
  - Versioning and naming conventions  
  - `npm publish` workflow  

---

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- Even simple UI components like dropdowns and carousels teach a lot about event handling and DOM manipulation.  
- Clean CSS makes interaction smoother (and debugging way less painful).  
- Publishing npm packages is just like open-sourcing — small steps can make code reusable by anyone.  

---

### 📌 Notes:
- Keeping practice lightweight but consistent adds up over time.  
- Might try publishing a small utility package in the future.
