# 💯 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code journey! 👨‍💻🚀  
This repo is my public log of learning, projects, bugs, breakthroughs.

Whether you're here to get inspired, review my progress, or just enjoy some nerdy commentary — I'm glad you're here.

## 📅 What is #100DaysOfCode?

The #100DaysOfCode challenge is a commitment to code for at least **1 hour every day for 100 days ( not consecutive )**

I’m following this challenge to:

- Reinforce my skills through daily practice
- Follow structured resources (like The Odin Project & CS50P)
- Build real, visible projects
- Share progress and learn publicly 🌱

## 🔥 Progress Logs

To keep things clean and readable, I’ve split the log into three separate markdown files:

| Log Part                         | Description                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📘 [Days 1–30](./day01-30.md)    | HTML/CSS foundations, small projects, and starting JS & Python (CS50P) |
| 📗 [Days 31–60](./day31-60.md)   | Intermediate projects, DOM mastery, and deeper JavaScript concepts     |
| 📙 [Days 61–100](./day61-100.md) | Final projects, real-world components, API usage, full-stack learning  |
