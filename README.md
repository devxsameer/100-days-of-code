# 💯 100 Days of Code: My Full Stack Web Dev Journey

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code journey! I'm starting my path to becoming a full stack web developer right after high school. Every day, I’ll learn something new and track my progress here.

### ✅ Day 1 - [6 April 2025]
Started with “what is Git?”
Ended with:
* branching like a ninja 🥷
* merging like a time traveler ⏳
* pushing to GitHub like a pro 🚀

I'm not saying I became a DevOps engineer today...  
...but Git Bash did call me “master” 😎

### ✅ Day 2 - [7 April 2025]
**Topic:** HTML Revision  
**What I learned:**
* Wrapped my head around HTML today — structure, semantics, and all the good stuff.  
* `Tags`, `nesting`, `forms`, `media`…  
* it's wild how much power is in the basics.  
* Already seeing how this lays the groundwork for everything else
