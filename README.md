# 💯 100 Days of Code: My Full Stack Web Dev Journey

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code journey! I'm starting my path to becoming a full stack web developer right after high school. Every day, I’ll learn something new and track my progress here.

### ✅ Day 1 - [6 April 2025]

Started with “what is Git?”
Ended with:

- branching like a ninja 🥷
- merging like a time traveler ⏳
- pushing to GitHub like a pro 🚀

I'm not saying I became a DevOps engineer today...  
...but Git Bash did call me “master” 😎

### ✅ Day 2 - [7 April 2025]

**Topic:** HTML Revision  
**What I learned:**

- Wrapped my head around HTML today — structure, semantics, and all the good stuff.
- `Tags`, `nesting`, `forms`, `media`…
- it's wild how much power is in the basics.
- Already seeing how this lays the groundwork for everything else

### ✅ Day 3 - [8 April 2025]

**Topic:** Project Using Only HTML  
**What I learned:**

- Built a fun little project: **"If HTML Tags Were People"** 😄
- Only used `HTML` — no `CSS`, no `JS`, just pure tag-powered creativity!
- Check it out and let me know what you think 👇
