# 💯 100 Days of Code: My Full Stack Web Dev Journey

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code journey! I'm starting my path to becoming a full stack web developer right after high school. Every day, I’ll learn something new and track my progress here.

### ✅ Day 1 - [6 April 2025]

Started with “what is Git?”
Ended with:

- branching like a ninja 🥷
- merging like a time traveler ⏳
- pushing to GitHub like a pro 🚀

I'm not saying I became a DevOps engineer today...  
...but Git Bash did call me “master” 😎
