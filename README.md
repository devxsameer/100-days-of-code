# 💯 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfCode** journey! 👨‍💻🚀  
This repo is my public log of learning, projects, bugs, and breakthroughs — basically, my developer diary (minus the coffee stains ☕).

Whether you're here to get inspired, review my progress, or just enjoy some nerdy commentary — I’m glad you stopped by!

## 📅 What is #100DaysOfCode?

The **#100DaysOfCode** challenge is a commitment to code for at least **1 hour every day for 100 days (not necessarily consecutive)**.

I’m doing this challenge to:

- Reinforce my skills through consistent daily practice
- Follow structured, high-quality resources (like **The Odin Project** & **CS50P**)
- Build real, visible, portfolio-worthy projects
- Share progress publicly — learning in the open 🌱

## 🧭 My Journey So Far

I’ve split my logs into separate files for readability and sanity (trust me, it gets long 😅):

## ☕ Final Thoughts

This challenge started with simple HTML and ended with complex React apps.  
From `console.log("Hello World")` to `useEffect()` dependencies — it’s been one wild ride.

This README (like me) will keep evolving. Check back later… it’ll probably have more puns and better code. 😄

### 📣 Let’s code. Every day. Even when the semicolon runs away.
