## âœ… Day 1 - [6 April 2025]
**Topic:** Git & GitHub Advanced Concepts  
**What I learned:**
- Core Git terminology (repo, commit, branch, merge, etc.)
- How Git works under the hood (staging area, HEAD, etc.)
- Creating and managing branches
- `git diff`, `git stash`, and `git tag` usage
- Deep dive into `rebase` and how it differs from `merge`
- `git reflog` and how to recover lost commits
- Set up my first GitHub repo to track this challenge

**Mood:** ðŸ§  Mind = Blown
