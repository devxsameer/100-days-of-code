### ðŸ“… Day 42 â€“ Deeper Dive: Closures, Modules, Scope & Hoisting

Today was all about reinforcing the core concepts I touched on yesterday â€” because clean, scalable JavaScript demands a strong mental model.

---

## âœ… What I Focused On

- ðŸ§  Revisited and deepened understanding of **Closures**
- ðŸŒ€ Practiced the **Module Pattern** using IIFE  
- ðŸ“¦ Explored how **scope** works with nested functions  
- ðŸš€ Clarified how **hoisting** affects variables and function declarations

---

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Closures are the backbone of private logic and persistent state  
- IIFEs are great for creating encapsulated modules  
- Understanding **hoisting** helps avoid confusing bugs and "undefined" errors  
- Scope rules shape whatâ€™s accessible â€” and whatâ€™s hidden

Feeling more confident now in applying these concepts to larger and cleaner codebases moving forward.
