## Day 56: Linters, Formatters & Composition over Inheritance ðŸ§¹âœ¨

### ðŸ”Ž Theme of the Day

Exploring code quality tools (**ESLint** & **Prettier**) and reinforcing design principles like **composition over inheritance** through The Odin Project.

---

### âœ… What I Worked On:

- Learned about **linters** (ESLint) and how they catch potential bugs & enforce consistent coding rules.
- Set up **Prettier** for automatic code formatting.
- Explored why many devs prefer **composition over inheritance** when structuring objects and behavior in JavaScript.
- Connected these tools & principles to building cleaner, more maintainable projects.

---

### ðŸ§  What I Learned:

- **ESLint** = the strict teacher pointing out your mistakes.
- **Prettier** = the friend who cleans up your messy desk without asking.
- **Composition > Inheritance**: instead of forcing everything into rigid hierarchies, build objects by combining smaller, reusable parts.
- Good tooling + good design principles = happier coding experience.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Notes:

- These tools donâ€™t just make code prettier â€” they save time and reduce arguments over style.
- Composition encourages flexibility and avoids the pitfalls of deep inheritance chains.

ðŸ“… **Progress:** Day 56/100 complete!
