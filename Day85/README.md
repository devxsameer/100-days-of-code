## 🌿 Theme: Responsive Design Mastery

---

## ✅ What I Learned / Did

- Completed nearly all the **Responsive Design** lessons in The Odin Project’s Advanced HTML & CSS curriculum (except the homepage project).
- Studied:

  - **Responsive Images** (srcset, sizes, art direction)
  - **Media Queries** for layout breakpoints
  - Natural responsiveness: fluid layouts, relative units
  - How to combine flexible grids, fluid images, and breakpoints for truly adaptive designs

- Prepared to start building the **Homepage Project**, applying all these responsive techniques in a real-world layout.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Responsive design is more than just “making things smaller” — it’s designing for context and device.
- Relative units (%, rem, vw/vh) + fluid layouts + breakpoints = flexible, resilient web pages.
- Responsive images matter: optimizing bandwidth and ensuring sharpness on multiple screens.
- Media queries should complement natural responsiveness, not replace it.
