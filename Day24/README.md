# 📅 Day 24 - #100DaysOfCode

Today was all about diving deeper into **CSS fundamentals**, continuing my journey through the **Full Stack JavaScript path** on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). 🎯

---

## ✅ What I Did

- 🔄 **Learned about CSS Resets**  
  - Understood how browsers apply default styles  
  - Explored different reset methods (Universal selector, Normalize.css, Eric Meyer's reset, etc.)
- 📏 **Studied CSS Units in Depth**
  - Absolute units: `px`, `cm`, `in`, etc.  
  - Relative units: `%`, `em`, `rem`, `vh`, `vw`, and when to use them  
  - Gained clarity on when and why to prefer relative units for responsive design

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- CSS resets are important to create consistency across browsers  
- Choosing the right unit impacts layout flexibility and accessibility  
- `rem` and `em` are powerful when used properly in scalable designs
