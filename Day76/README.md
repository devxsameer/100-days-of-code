## 🔍 Theme: Testing Basics & Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Today I worked through The Odin Project’s *Testing Basics* lesson and got hands-on with the fundamentals of TDD and writing simple tests with Jest.

---

## ✅ What I Learned / Did

- What TDD is: writing tests *before* writing the code to satisfy them. 
- Set up Jest and ran basic test suites. 
- Explored Jest matchers (e.g. `toEqual`, `toBe`, etc.) and how to assert behavior.  
- Reflected on benefits of TDD: better code design, fewer bugs, more confidence making changes.
---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- TDD encourages clean design: smaller, focused units of work.  
- Tests help guard against regression when refactoring.  
- Using Jest, writing tests is straightforward, but the mindset shift (test-first) takes practice.  
- Even simple tests (unit-level) are super valuable and build trust in your code.

## 📈 Reflection

Today wasn’t about building big features, but about laying strong foundations.  
Writing tests first might feel slower at first, but it saves trouble later.
