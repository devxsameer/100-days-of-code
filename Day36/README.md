### 📅 Day 36 - Objects, Prototypes & Inheritance

Today I dove deep into **JavaScript object-oriented fundamentals** through the curriculum in **The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript Path**.

It was a solid brain workout, but now I finally see why people say **“everything in JavaScript is an object”** (including my confusion 😅).

## ✅ What I Learned

- 📦 How to create and use **JavaScript objects**
- 🛠️ Building **object constructors** using the `function` keyword
- 🧬 Explored the **prototype chain** and **prototypal inheritance**
- 🔄 Understood how methods and properties are shared via `.prototype`
- 🔍 Clarified how `this` works in different contexts

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Prototypes help avoid method duplication across object instances
- Constructors provide a clean pattern for reusable object creation
- `this` in JavaScript depends heavily on **how** a function is called
- Objects and their inheritance system form the base of many JS features

---

## 🔜 What's Next?

- Practice building small reusable object-based components
- Start solving JS exercises to reinforce object creation and inheritance
- Continue with the next section in The Odin Project curriculum

Loving how JavaScript is starting to “click” — one object at a time. 🔧🧠
