### ðŸ“… Day 37â€“38 â€“ Built LibraryX ðŸ“š (JavaScript Book Tracker App)

Over the past two days, I designed, developed, and completed **LibraryX**, a dynamic book management app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” as outlined in The Odin Project's curriculum, with some personal creative upgrades.

## âœ… What I Built

ðŸ“¦ **LibraryX â€“ A JavaScript-powered library app**  
ðŸ”— [Live Demo](https://devxsameer.github.io/libraryx/) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/devxsameer/libraryx)

### ðŸ’¡ Features:

- Add, delete, and update books (title, author, pages, status)
- Toggle reading status directly in the UI
- Fully responsive layout (CSS Grid + Flexbox)
- ðŸ’¾ Stores book data and theme preference in **localStorage**
- ðŸŒ— Built-in **dark/light mode** with smooth theme switching

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts I Applied

- âœ… Used **object constructors** to model books
- âœ… Shared methods via **prototypes**
- âœ… Implemented form validation & DOM event handling
- âœ… Applied custom CSS variables for theming
- âœ… Persisted data using `localStorage` (books + theme)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights

- First project where I used **object-oriented JavaScript** in a practical way
- Enhanced user experience with theme preference memory
- Polished, mobile-friendly interface with no frameworks â€” just vanilla code

This project gave me a great hands-on intro to structuring JavaScript apps with reusable logic and clean UI. ðŸ“šðŸ”¥
