# 📅 Day 17 - #100DaysOfCode

Continuing my JavaScript journey — today was all about deep diving into **DOM manipulation** and **event handling**. Plus, I added interactivity to my Rock Paper Scissors game! 🎮

## ✅ What I Did

- Completed more lessons from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) JavaScript Foundations track
- Learned and practiced:
  - 📄 Selecting and manipulating DOM elements (`querySelector`, `innerText`, `classList`, etc.)
  - 🧠 Understanding the structure of the DOM tree
  - 🖱️ Handling **events** like `click`, `mouseover`, and `submit`
  - ⏱️ Using `addEventListener()` for interactive elements
- Enhanced my **Rock Paper Scissors game**:
  - Replaced `console.log` gameplay with button-based interactivity
  - Displayed results and scores in the browser dynamically
  - Added win/loss logic

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- The DOM is where JavaScript meets HTML — understanding it unlocks the ability to build interactive UIs
- Event-driven programming is core to web apps
- Even a small game like Rock Paper Scissors becomes so much more fun with a little interactivity!
