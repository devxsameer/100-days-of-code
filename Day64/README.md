# Day 64 - #100DaysOfCode

**Quick Summary:**  
Async/await leveled up, APIs unlocked — now coding with GIFs and weather vibes. 🌦️😂

---

## What I Did Today
- Dived deeper into **async/await** — really understood how it simplifies working with asynchronous code.  
- Started working with **APIs** in practice.  
  - Played around with the **Giphy API** to fetch and display GIFs.  
  - Experimented with the **Visual Crossing Weather API** to pull real-time weather data.  

---

## Key Takeaways
- `async/await` makes asynchronous flows feel natural and avoids callback hell.  
- APIs can bring real-world data (like GIFs and weather) straight into your projects.  
- Combining multiple APIs can add both fun and utility to web apps.

✅ From GIFs to forecasts — async/await makes the future look bright *and* funny.
