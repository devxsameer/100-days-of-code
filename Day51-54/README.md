# ðŸ“… Days 51â€“54 â€” #100DaysOfCode

**Theme:** From idea to launch â€” building my best project yet: crispTasks âœ…

---

## ðŸ”¹ Quick Summary

Across four focused days, I designed, built, and shipped **crispTasks**, a modern toâ€‘do and project manager using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS with ES Modules. It supports multiâ€‘projects, rich tasks (due dates, priorities, notes), persistent checklists, a global dashboard with sorting, and full localStorage persistence. Deployed and documented.

## ðŸ›  What I Did Each Day

- **Day 51:** Project scaffolding, UI wireframe, Webpack + npm scripts setup, ES module structure, base components (sidebar, header, layout).
- **Day 52:** Projects CRUD, tasks CRUD (title, description, due date, priority, notes), data model, localStorage persistence layer.
- **Day 53:** Dashboard (all tasks across projects), quick stats, sorting (priority, date added, due date, title), dialogs (add/edit/delete), Lucide icons, dateâ€‘fns integration.
- **Day 54:** Checklist per task with persistent completion, responsive styles, UX polish (confirmations, focus states), final refactor, README, and deployment to GitHub Pages.
