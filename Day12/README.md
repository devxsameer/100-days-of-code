# 📅 Day 12 - #100DaysOfCode

Today marks the beginning of my journey into **JavaScript**! 🚀  
I focused on learning the fundamentals and setting up my environment for future JS projects.

---

## ✅ What I Did Today

- 🔹 Learned about **variables** and how to declare them using `let`, `const`, and `var`
- 🔹 Explored **JavaScript operators** (arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical)
- 🔹 Installed **Node.js** using **NVM** (Node Version Manager)
- 🔹 Understood different **data types** (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, object)
- 🔹 Practiced using **conditional statements** (`if`, `else if`, `else`, and `switch`)

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

- Installed **Node.js** with **NVM** for flexible version management
- Wrote and tested JS code using the Node REPL and simple `.js` files

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- JavaScript is loosely typed — understanding type behavior is key!
- `let` and `const` are block-scoped and preferred over `var`
- Logical thinking is at the core of using conditionals effectively
- Setting up Node.js properly will help in running and testing JS code locally
