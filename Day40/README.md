### 📅 Day 40 – Scopes, Closures & Factory Functions

Today I explored some of the core concepts that make JavaScript both powerful and (let’s be honest) a little brain-twisting.

---

## ✅ What I Learned

- 🔐 **Scope** — how variables live and die in different contexts  
- 🧠 **Closures** — functions that remember the scope they were born in  
- 🏭 **Factory functions** — creating multiple object instances with shared logic

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Closures = private variables without needing classes  
- Factory functions = a clean, modular way to create reusable objects  
- Scope matters... especially when your variables mysteriously vanish 👻
