# 📅 Day 29 - #100DaysOfCode

Today was all about **forms, validation, and putting it all into practice**. I started with the theory and wrapped up by building a full sign-up page from scratch! 🧾💻

---

## ✅ What I Did

- 🧠 Learned about **HTML form elements** and input types  
- 🛡️ Studied **form validation** techniques:
  - `required`, `pattern`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, `type="email"` and more
  - Used **HTML5 validation** for real-time feedback
- 🎯 Focused most of the day building the **WildWolf Sign-Up Form Project**:
  - Responsive layout with **Flexbox**
  - Clean form design with **CSS**
  - Styled validation feedback and error states
  - Custom branding: **"Join the Pack — Sign Up Now!" 🐺**

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- HTML + CSS alone can create very usable, stylish forms
- Validation doesn’t always need JavaScript — HTML5 does a lot!
- Good form UX requires attention to spacing, error handling, and accessibility
