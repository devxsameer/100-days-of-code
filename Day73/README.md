# 🚀 Day 73 of #100DaysOfCode

## 🌳 Binary Search Trees (BST)  
- Completed the **Binary Search Tree Project** from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  
- Implemented core BST operations:  
  - ✅ Insert, Delete, Find  
  - ✅ In-order, Pre-order, Post-order traversals  
  - ✅ Check balance & rebalance tree  
- Built a driver script to tie everything together.  
- Got hands-on with recursion, depth-first traversals, and balancing logic.  
- Repo: [odin-bst](https://github.com/devxsameer/odin-bst)

## ♞ Knight Travails  
- Started and finished the **Knight Travails Project** today.  
- Implemented a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to calculate the knight’s shortest path.  
- Added a **UI demo** with an interactive chessboard:  
  - 🎲 Random knight placement  
  - ⚡ Travails shortest path animation  
  - 🧹 Reset board option  
- Live Demo: [Knight Travails on GitHub Pages](https://devxsameer.github.io/knight-travails/)  
- Repo: [knight-travails](https://github.com/devxsameer/knight-travails)

## 🎯 Key Learnings  
- Reinforced my understanding of **trees** and **graph algorithms**.  
- BFS is a real hero for shortest paths 🦸‍♂️.  
- Practiced connecting **algorithm logic** with **UI visualization**.  
- Today was all about mixing **theory with practical coding fun**.  

---

## 💡 Reflection  
Today felt like a **double power-up** in data structures and algorithms:  
- BSTs sharpened my recursion + balancing knowledge.  
- Knight Travails was a perfect BFS playground.  

Safe to say, **Day 73 was packed with algorithmic gym reps** 🏋️‍♂️.
