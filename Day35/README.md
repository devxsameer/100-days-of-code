### 📅 Day 35 - FAQs, Functions & Fresh CSS

Today was a solid mix of frontend fun and Python logic.  
I focused on reinforcing my core skills through a mini-project, some revision, and another CS50P submission.

## ✅ What I Did

- 🧩 Created a fun **FAQ Design** project using only HTML and CSS

  - Designed 4 developer-themed questions with list-style answers
  - Practiced layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy
  - Added to my `basic-projects` repo
  - 🔗 [`Live Demo`](https://devxsameer.github.io/basic-projects/faq-design) | 🔗 See `faq-design` in my [`basic-projects Repo`](https://github.com/devxsameer/basic-projects)

- 🧠 **Revised** previous frontend topics through The Odin Project

- 🐍 **Submitted Problem Set 3** of **CS50P**

## 💡 Key Takeaways
