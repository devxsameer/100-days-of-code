### ✅ Day 2 - [7 April 2025]
**Topic:** HTML Revision
**What I learned:**
- Wrapped my head around HTML today — structure, semantics, and all the good stuff.  
- `Tags`, `nesting`, `forms`, `media`…  
- it's wild how much power is in the basics.  
- Already seeing how this lays the groundwork for everything else
