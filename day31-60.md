<summary><strong>Day 31 - [1 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today wasn’t about breakthroughs or new syntax — just a calm day of **revision and reinforcement**.

**What I Did:**

- Reviewed key HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts learned in the past
- Took time to mentally map what I’ve covered so far

**What's Next?:**

- Continue with CSS Grid learning from where I left off
- Start a mini layout or component project using Grid

It’s Day 31. Not fancy. Just focused.

<summary><strong>Day 32-33 - [3-4 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** After a light revision on Day 31, I jumped into one of my most polished projects so far — a fully responsive **Admin Dashboard UI** built with just **HTML** and **CSS** [little JS to toggle classes].

**What I Did:**

- Created a complete **dashboard layout** using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**
- Designed sidebar, navbar, content cards and other sections
- Implemented a fully functional **Dark Mode** using class toggling and CSS variables
- Focused on **layout consistency**, **component reuse**, and responsive design

Two solid days of code, layout, and low-key loving Grid

<summary><strong>Day 34 - [16 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** After a much-needed break to focus on my **IIT Madras BS qualifier exam** (which I passed with 90%! 🎉), I’m officially back on the #100DaysOfCode grind.

Today wasn’t about speed — it was about **rebuilding rhythm**.

**What I Did:**

- Reviewed key CSS concepts: Grid, Flexbox, layout structure
- Revisited my Admin Dashboard project to refresh styling logic
- Light revision of previous projects and notes
- Refocused my roadmap for upcoming sections of The Odin Project

<summary><strong>Day 35 - [19 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today was a solid mix of frontend fun and Python logic.  
I focused on reinforcing my core skills through a mini-project, some revision, and another CS50P submission.

**What I Did:**

- 🧩 Created a fun **FAQ Design** project using only HTML and CSS

  - Designed 4 developer-themed questions with list-style answers
  - Practiced layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy
  - Added to my `basic-projects` repo
  - 🔗 [`Live Demo`](https://devxsameer.github.io/basic-projects/faq-design) | 🔗 See `faq-design` in my [`basic-projects Repo`](https://github.com/devxsameer/basic-projects)

- 🧠 **Revised** previous frontend topics through The Odin Project

- 🐍 **Submitted Problem Set 3** of **CS50P**

  <summary><strong>Day 36 - [20 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today I dove deep into **JavaScript object-oriented fundamentals** through the curriculum in **The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript Path**.

It was a solid brain workout, but now I finally see why people say **“everything in JavaScript is an object”** (including my confusion 😅).

**What I Learnt:**

- 📦 How to create and use **JavaScript objects**
- 🛠️ Building **object constructors** using the `function` keyword
- 🧬 Explored the **prototype chain** and **prototypal inheritance**
- 🔄 Understood how methods and properties are shared via `.prototype`
- 🔍 Clarified how `this` works in different contexts

Loving how JavaScript is starting to “click” — one object at a time. 🔧🧠
