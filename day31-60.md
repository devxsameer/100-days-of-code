<summary><strong>Day 31 - [1 June 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today wasn’t about breakthroughs or new syntax — just a calm day of **revision and reinforcement**.

**What I Did:**

- Reviewed key HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts learned in the past
- Took time to mentally map what I’ve covered so far

**What's Next?:**

- Continue with CSS Grid learning from where I left off
- Start a mini layout or component project using Grid

It’s Day 31. Not fancy. Just focused.

<summary><strong>Day 32-33 - [3-4 June 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** After a light revision on Day 31, I jumped into one of my most polished projects so far — a fully responsive **Admin Dashboard UI** built with just **HTML** and **CSS** [little JS to toggle classes].

**What I Did:**

- Created a complete **dashboard layout** using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**
- Designed sidebar, navbar, content cards and other sections
- Implemented a fully functional **Dark Mode** using class toggling and CSS variables
- Focused on **layout consistency**, **component reuse**, and responsive design

Two solid days of code, layout, and low-key loving Grid
