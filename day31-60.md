<summary><strong>Day 31 - [1 June 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today wasn’t about breakthroughs or new syntax — just a calm day of **revision and reinforcement**.

**What I Did:**

- Reviewed key HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts learned in the past
- Took time to mentally map what I’ve covered so far

**What's Next?:**

- Continue with CSS Grid learning from where I left off  
- Start a mini layout or component project using Grid  

It’s Day 31. Not fancy. Just focused.
