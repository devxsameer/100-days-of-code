    <summary><strong>Day 36 - [20 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today I dove deep into **JavaScript object-oriented fundamentals** through the curriculum in **The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript Path**.

It was a solid brain workout, but now I finally see why people say **“everything in JavaScript is an object”** (including my confusion 😅).

**What I Learnt:**

- 📦 How to create and use **JavaScript objects**
- 🛠️ Building **object constructors** using the `function` keyword
- 🧬 Explored the **prototype chain** and **prototypal inheritance**
- 🔄 Understood how methods and properties are shared via `.prototype`
- 🔍 Clarified how `this` works in different contexts

Loving how JavaScript is starting to “click” — one object at a time. 🔧🧠

  <summary><strong>Day 37-38 - [21-22 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Over the past two days, I designed, developed, and completed **LibraryX**, a dynamic book management app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — as outlined in The Odin Project's curriculum, with some personal creative upgrades.

**What I Built:**

📦 **LibraryX – A JavaScript-powered library app**  
🔗 [Live Demo](https://devxsameer.github.io/libraryx/) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/devxsameer/libraryx)

**Features:**

- Add, delete, and update books (title, author, pages, status)
- Toggle reading status directly in the UI
- Fully responsive layout (CSS Grid + Flexbox)
- 💾 Stores book data and theme preference in **localStorage**
- 🌗 Built-in **dark/light mode** with smooth theme switching

This project gave me a great hands-on intro to structuring JavaScript apps with reusable logic and clean UI. 📚🔥

  <summary><strong>Day 39 - [23 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today was a revision-focused day — I went over everything I’ve worked on in the past several days to solidify the concepts before moving forward.

**What I Reviewed:**

- 🧱 JavaScript **object constructors** & **prototypes**
- 📚 Logic & structure of my recent **LibraryX** project
- 💡 DOM manipulation, event handling, and layout design

Some days are about writing code.  
Others are about understanding the code you've already written.

  <summary><strong>Day 40 - [24 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today I explored some of the core concepts that make JavaScript both powerful and (let’s be honest) a little brain-twisting.

**What I Learnt:**

- 🔐 **Scope** — how variables live and die in different contexts
- 🧠 **Closures** — functions that remember the scope they were born in
- 🏭 **Factory functions** — creating multiple object instances with shared logic

On to building with these tools next!

  <summary><strong>Day 41 - [25 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today I explored the **Module Pattern** in JavaScript — a powerful way to write organized, encapsulated code — along with some important concepts that build on what I’ve learned recently.

**What I Learnt:**

- 🧩 **Module Pattern** using IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)
- 🔒 Creating **private variables and functions** via closures
- 🧪 Combining **factory functions** with **prototypal inheritance**
- 🔁 Revisited closures, scope, and object creation for clarity

All of this is setting the stage for more structured and reusable code in future projects.

  <summary><strong>Day 42 - [27 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today was all about reinforcing the core concepts I touched on yesterday — because clean, scalable JavaScript demands a strong mental model.

**What I Focused On:**

- 🧠 Revisited and deepened understanding of **Closures**
- 🌀 Practiced the **Module Pattern** using IIFE
- 📦 Explored how **scope** works with nested functions
- 🚀 Clarified how **hoisting** affects variables and function declarations

Feeling more confident now in applying these concepts to larger and cleaner codebases moving forward.

  <summary><strong>Day 43-44 - [28-29 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Over the last two days, I built a fully functional **Tic Tac Toe game** as part of The Odin Project — and made sure to architect it with clean, scalable, modular JavaScript.

**What I Built:**

🎮 **Tic Tac Toe**  
🔗 [Live Demo](https://devxsameer.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/devxsameer/tic-tac-toe)

**Key Features:**

- Modular structure using **IIFEs** and the **Module Pattern**
- **No global variables** — everything is neatly scoped
- Created a custom **Publish–Subscribe (PubSub)** system to manage events
- Clean, user-friendly UI with dynamic feedback
- Win/draw detection, turn indicators, and restart functionality

This project helped solidify how to build interactive apps with **modular architecture** and custom event handling — all while keeping the global scope squeaky clean.

Onward to the next challenge!

  <summary><strong>Day 45 - [30 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today was a lighter day — I spent about an hour going through some **JavaScript design patterns** to get a better understanding of how reusable solutions are structured in code.

**What I Did:**

- Skimmed and studied a few common patterns:
  - 🧩 **Module Pattern**
  - 🏭 **Factory Pattern**
  - 📦 **Revealing Module Pattern**
- Looked at real-world examples of how these patterns are used in JS apps

Even a short session can help build intuition for clean, maintainable code.  
Design patterns help move from "it works" to "it scales."

Looking forward to applying these in future projects!

  <summary><strong>Day 46-47 - [4-5 august 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** The last two days were a deep dive into **modern JavaScript architecture** — including the mystical realms of **classes**, **modules**, and the toolchains that somehow make it all browser-friendly.

**What I Learnt:**

- 🧱 **JavaScript Classes**

  - Mastered `constructor`, `this`, `extends`, `super`, and `static`
  - Basically turned JavaScript into diet Java

- 📦 **ES Modules (ESM)**

  - `import` and `export` — finally, some organization!

- 🧪 **NPM**

  - Learned how to initialize a project, install packages, and still forget to add `--save-dev` out of habit

- 🔧 **Webpack**
  - Built my first config file like a wizard with a manual
  - Explored entry/output, loaders, bundling, and the eternal question: "Why is this build folder 30MB?"

It was two days of few commits, but a ton of config, brain stretch, and realizing how much JavaScript has grown up.

  <summary><strong>Day 48-49 - [6-7 august 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Started and completed the **Restaurant Page** project from The Odin Project.

**What I Worked On:**

- Project Name: **Byte and Dine**
- Set up **Webpack** and configured loaders, plugins, and `webpack-dev-server`.
- Practiced using **npm**, scripts, and local development environment setup.
- Used **JavaScript ES6 modules** to dynamically render pages: `Home`, `Menu`, and `About`.
- Modularized content and used DOM manipulation to update the page based on navigation.
- Learned how to bundle and build the app using `npm run build`.

📌 This project took me two focused days, and I now feel more confident in setting up modern dev environments for JS projects!

  - Structure and syntax
  - How to parse and stringify JSON data
  - Practical uses in web applications
- Studied **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** in JavaScript:
  - Encapsulation

  <summary><strong>Day 51-54 - [14-17 august 2025]</strong></summary>
  
**Topic:** From idea to launch — building my best project yet: crispTasks ✅

**What I Built:**

Across four focused days, I designed, built, and shipped **crispTasks**, a modern to‑do and project manager using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS with ES Modules. It supports multi‑projects, rich tasks (due dates, priorities, notes), persistent checklists, a global dashboard with sorting, and full localStorage persistence. Deployed and documented.

**Topic:** A light day focused on revising some core software design principles — mainly **SOLID** and **loose coupling**.

**What I Did:**

- Revised **SOLID principles** and their role in writing clean, scalable code.
- Refreshed the importance of **loose coupling** between components for maintainability.
- Reflected on how these principles can improve project architecture long term.

**Progress:** Day 55/100 complete!
