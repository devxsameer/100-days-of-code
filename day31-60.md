<summary><strong>Day 31 - [1 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today wasn’t about breakthroughs or new syntax — just a calm day of **revision and reinforcement**.

**What I Did:**

- Reviewed key HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts learned in the past
- Took time to mentally map what I’ve covered so far

**What's Next?:**

- Continue with CSS Grid learning from where I left off
- Start a mini layout or component project using Grid

It’s Day 31. Not fancy. Just focused.

<summary><strong>Day 32-33 - [3-4 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** After a light revision on Day 31, I jumped into one of my most polished projects so far — a fully responsive **Admin Dashboard UI** built with just **HTML** and **CSS** [little JS to toggle classes].

**What I Did:**

- Created a complete **dashboard layout** using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**
- Designed sidebar, navbar, content cards and other sections
- Implemented a fully functional **Dark Mode** using class toggling and CSS variables
- Focused on **layout consistency**, **component reuse**, and responsive design

Two solid days of code, layout, and low-key loving Grid

<summary><strong>Day 34 - [16 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** After a much-needed break to focus on my **IIT Madras BS qualifier exam** (which I passed with 90%! 🎉), I’m officially back on the #100DaysOfCode grind.

Today wasn’t about speed — it was about **rebuilding rhythm**.

**What I Did:**

- Reviewed key CSS concepts: Grid, Flexbox, layout structure
- Revisited my Admin Dashboard project to refresh styling logic
- Light revision of previous projects and notes
- Refocused my roadmap for upcoming sections of The Odin Project

<summary><strong>Day 35 - [19 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today was a solid mix of frontend fun and Python logic.  
I focused on reinforcing my core skills through a mini-project, some revision, and another CS50P submission.

**What I Did:**

- 🧩 Created a fun **FAQ Design** project using only HTML and CSS

  - Designed 4 developer-themed questions with list-style answers
  - Practiced layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy
  - Added to my `basic-projects` repo
  - 🔗 [`Live Demo`](https://devxsameer.github.io/basic-projects/faq-design) | 🔗 See `faq-design` in my [`basic-projects Repo`](https://github.com/devxsameer/basic-projects)

- 🧠 **Revised** previous frontend topics through The Odin Project

- 🐍 **Submitted Problem Set 3** of **CS50P**

    <summary><strong>Day 36 - [20 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today I dove deep into **JavaScript object-oriented fundamentals** through the curriculum in **The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript Path**.

It was a solid brain workout, but now I finally see why people say **“everything in JavaScript is an object”** (including my confusion 😅).

**What I Learnt:**

- 📦 How to create and use **JavaScript objects**
- 🛠️ Building **object constructors** using the `function` keyword
- 🧬 Explored the **prototype chain** and **prototypal inheritance**
- 🔄 Understood how methods and properties are shared via `.prototype`
- 🔍 Clarified how `this` works in different contexts

Loving how JavaScript is starting to “click” — one object at a time. 🔧🧠

  <summary><strong>Day 37-38 - [21-22 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Over the past two days, I designed, developed, and completed **LibraryX**, a dynamic book management app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — as outlined in The Odin Project's curriculum, with some personal creative upgrades.

**What I Built:**

📦 **LibraryX – A JavaScript-powered library app**  
🔗 [Live Demo](https://devxsameer.github.io/libraryx/) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/devxsameer/libraryx)

**Features:**

- Add, delete, and update books (title, author, pages, status)
- Toggle reading status directly in the UI
- Fully responsive layout (CSS Grid + Flexbox)
- 💾 Stores book data and theme preference in **localStorage**
- 🌗 Built-in **dark/light mode** with smooth theme switching

This project gave me a great hands-on intro to structuring JavaScript apps with reusable logic and clean UI. 📚🔥

  <summary><strong>Day 39 - [23 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today was a revision-focused day — I went over everything I’ve worked on in the past several days to solidify the concepts before moving forward.

**What I Reviewed:**

- 🧱 JavaScript **object constructors** & **prototypes**
- 📚 Logic & structure of my recent **LibraryX** project
- 💡 DOM manipulation, event handling, and layout design

Some days are about writing code.  
Others are about understanding the code you've already written.

  <summary><strong>Day 40 - [24 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today I explored some of the core concepts that make JavaScript both powerful and (let’s be honest) a little brain-twisting.

**What I Learnt:**

- 🔐 **Scope** — how variables live and die in different contexts
- 🧠 **Closures** — functions that remember the scope they were born in
- 🏭 **Factory functions** — creating multiple object instances with shared logic

On to building with these tools next!

  <summary><strong>Day 41 - [25 july 2025]</strong></summary>

**Topic:** Today I explored the **Module Pattern** in JavaScript — a powerful way to write organized, encapsulated code — along with some important concepts that build on what I’ve learned recently.

**What I Learnt:**

- 🧩 **Module Pattern** using IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)
- 🔒 Creating **private variables and functions** via closures
- 🧪 Combining **factory functions** with **prototypal inheritance**
- 🔁 Revisited closures, scope, and object creation for clarity

All of this is setting the stage for more structured and reusable code in future projects.
