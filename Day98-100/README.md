# 🧠 Days 98–100 of #100DaysOfCode

### 🗓️ Summary

The **final boss battle** of my 100 Days of Code — a 3-day sprint to build **Arcadia**, a full-fledged video game discovery web app powered by the **RAWG API**. 🎮

These last days were all about polishing my React mastery — from **routing and data fetching** to **caching, infinite scroll**, and crafting a seamless **UI experience**.  
A perfect endgame to the Odin Project’s React path — equal parts code, creativity, and chaos. 🚀

### ⚡ **Days 98–100 – Building _Arcadia: The Game Discovery Hub_**

Arcadia is a **React + Vite** project that lets users **discover, explore, and favorite** video games using real-time data from the RAWG database.  
Think of it as your personal gaming library — clean, fast, and aesthetic.

#### 🧩 What I Built

- 🌍 A complete **multi-page React app** using **React Router v7**
- 🎮 **Dynamic game discovery** — trending, upcoming, top-rated, genre-based, and more
- 🔍 **Search functionality** that fetches live results from the RAWG API
- ♾️ **Infinite scrolling** powered by **TanStack React Query** for smooth pagination
- ❤️ **Favorites system** using a custom store + localStorage (with tab synchronization)
- 🧱 **Genre and Discover sections** that auto-load data with dynamic routes
- 🖼️ **Responsive gallery layout** using `react-masonry-css`
- 💫 **TailwindCSS v4 design** with gradients, dark theme, and interactive transitions
- 🧭 **Breadcrumb navigation**, **error pages**, and **ScrollToTop** behavior for polished UX

#### 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Structuring a React app for scalability — clean folder and routing architecture
- Efficient **API fetching, caching, and pagination** with React Query
- Implementing **custom global stores** with `useSyncExternalStore`
- Handling **dynamic route params** and **URL search params** cleanly
- Fine-tuning **infinite scroll logic** using IntersectionObserver

### 💬 Reflection

Days 98–100 felt like a **true final quest** — a culmination of every React skill I’ve learned during this 100-day journey.  
From debugging endless API calls to fine-tuning UI details, **Arcadia** became more than just a project — it’s my statement piece as a developer. 💪

I wrapped up the challenge not just with a finished app, but with the confidence to build **production-level React projects** from scratch.  
This was the perfect way to close out #100DaysOfCode — with a game about games. 🕹️
