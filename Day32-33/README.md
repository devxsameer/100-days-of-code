### ðŸ“… Day 32â€“33 - Admin Dashboard + Dark Mode

After a light revision on Day 31, I jumped into one of my most polished projects so far â€” a fully responsive **Admin Dashboard UI** built with just **HTML** and **CSS** [little JS to toggle classes].

---

## âœ… What I Worked On

- Created a complete **dashboard layout** using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**
- Designed sidebar, navbar, content cards and other sections
- Implemented a fully functional **Dark Mode** using class toggling and CSS variables
- Focused on **layout consistency**, **component reuse**, and responsive design

Two solid days of code, layout, and low-key loving Grid
