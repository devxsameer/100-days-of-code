# 📅 Day 11 - #100DaysOfCode

Today was all about layout and design! I completed two landing page projects that pushed my understanding of HTML and CSS to the next level. 🎯

## 🧱 First Project : Odin Landing Page

Built as part of [`The Odin Project`](https://www.theodinproject.com/), this project helped me apply Flexbox and semantic HTML to recreate a professional-looking landing page based on a reference design.

### ✅ Key Concepts Practiced:

- Semantic HTML structure
- Flexbox layout
- Typography with Google Fonts
- Basic responsive layout techniques

## 🍕 Second Project : Responsive Restaurant Landing Page with List Design (Without Media Queries)

This was a custom landing page with List Design inspired by a restaurant-themed design image. The challenge? I made it **fully responsive** using **only Flexbox**, with **no media queries** at all!

🔗 See `landing-page-list-design` in [`my basic-projects repo`](https://github.com/devxsameer/basic-projects)

### ✅ Key Concepts Practiced:

- Responsive layout using just Flexbox
- Flexible widths, `flex-wrap`, and scaling
- Visual design structure and typography
- Creativity + layout challenge!

## 💡 Takeaways

- Flexbox is extremely powerful for building responsive layouts.
- Structure, spacing, and consistent typography make a big visual difference.
- Recreating real-world layouts is one of the best ways to learn CSS.
