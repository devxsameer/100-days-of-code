## ðŸŽ¨ Theme: Advanced CSS Animations â€” Transitions, Transforms & Keyframes

---

## âœ… What I Learned / Did

- Completed the **Transitions** lesson:  
  Understood how to animate changes of CSS properties using `transition-property`, `transition-duration`, `timing-function`, and `delay`.
- Worked through the **Transforms** lesson:  
  Learned how to apply 2D/3D transforms (translate, rotate, scale, skew) and chain multiple transforms together.

- Finished the **Keyframes / Animations** lesson:  
  Explored how animations differ from transitions, how to configure animation properties, and how to define `@keyframes` for sequencing.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- **Transitions** are great for simple state changes (hover, focus, toggles).
- **Transforms** let you manipulate an elementâ€™s shape, position, or rotation in more creative ways.
- **Animations / Keyframes** provide full control: looping, alternate directions, and multi-step sequences.
- Using animations over transitions is useful when you need control beyond start â†’ end (e.g. loops, pauses).
- Good practice is to animate properties like `transform` and `opacity` for better performance.

## ðŸ”­ Reflection

Today felt like unlocking CSS superpowers. Instead of just static pages, now elements can move, rotate, and dance.  
Being able to animate UI will make future projects feel more lively and professional.
