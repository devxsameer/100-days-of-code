# 🚀 Day 86–87 of #100DaysOfCode

## 🗓️ Theme: From Polishing Pixels to Reacting Right ⚡

The last two days were a combo of **creativity and curiosity** — I wrapped up my custom **Homepage Project** (a fully responsive, accessible portfolio page) and dove headfirst into **React** through The Odin Project’s “React Introduction” lessons.

## 🎨 Day 86 – Building My Custom Homepage

While The Odin Project gave a simple homepage prompt, I decided to go full “frontend Picasso” and design something unique.

### 💡 What I Did

- Built a **fully responsive developer homepage** from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- Added a **custom loader animation**, **scroll spy navigation**, and **smooth transitions**
- Ensured the design is **accessible**, semantic, and screen-reader friendly
- Implemented **dark mode aesthetic**, **hamburger menu**, and section-based navigation
- Showcased my Odin projects (Battleship, Zephyr, CrispTasks, LibraryX, etc.)

### 🧠 Key Learnings

- Deepened my understanding of **responsive layouts** (Flexbox + media queries)
- Learned to implement **scroll-based event handling** and animation timing
- Focused on **accessibility best practices**
- Gained better CSS structure and variable management skills

## ⚛️ Day 87 – Stepping into React

After wrapping up my homepage, I began The Odin Project’s **React Introduction** lessons.  
This was the official start of my **React journey**, and I already love it! 😎

### 💻 What I Learned

- **What React is** and how it differs from regular JavaScript
- The difference between a **framework** and a **library**
- How React’s **component-based architecture** simplifies UI development
- Setting up a project using **Vite + React** (super fast ⚡)
- A first look at **JSX**, **rendering**, and **ReactDOM**

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

- React doesn’t reinvent the wheel — it just gives the wheel reusable components
- JSX makes writing UI feel intuitive once you stop trying to put semicolons everywhere
- Vite is a lifesaver compared to manual setups — fast dev server, instant reloads
- Understanding **React’s declarative mindset** is the real game changer

## 🧩 Reflection

These two days felt like crossing a bridge —  
from handcrafting DOM elements manually to letting React handle them intelligently.  
One side was **CSS artistry**, the other was **component wizardry** — and I’m officially walking into React-land with style 🪄

**HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript (ES6)**, **Vite**, **React**, **Accessibility Principles**
