### 📅 Day 45 – A Light Read on JS Design Patterns

Today was a lighter day — I spent about an hour going through some **JavaScript design patterns** to get a better understanding of how reusable solutions are structured in code.

---

## ✅ What I Did

- Skimmed and studied a few common patterns:
  - 🧩 **Module Pattern**
  - 🏭 **Factory Pattern**
  - 📦 **Revealing Module Pattern**
- Looked at real-world examples of how these patterns are used in JS apps

---

## 💡 Takeaway

Even a short session can help build intuition for clean, maintainable code.  
Design patterns help move from "it works" to "it scales."

Looking forward to applying these in future projects!
