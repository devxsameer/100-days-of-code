# 🧠 Days 94–96 of #100DaysOfCode

### 🗓️ Summary

A 3-day ninja training arc filled with review, memory mastery, and a full-blown Naruto-themed React project!  
From revisiting past React lessons to building a fully functional memory game, these days were all about sharpening skills, debugging like a Jonin, and styling like a UI Hokage. 🍥

### 🌀 **Day 94 – React Revision & Chakra Focus**

Before diving into another Odin Project challenge, I took the day to revisit what I’d learned so far in React.  
Re-explored:

- JSX fundamentals
- Component structure and props
- React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- State management patterns and clean code practices

Basically, I pressed the “Shadow Clone Refresh” button to ensure my React basics were battle-ready.

### ⚡ **Days 95 & 96 – Building _Flippuden: The Naruto Memory Challenge_**

Created a complete **React + Vite** project called **Flippuden**, a Naruto-themed memory card game where you test your recall by selecting unique characters fetched live from the **Dattebayo API**.

#### 🧩 What I Built

- A **React-powered game board** with dynamic shuffling (Fisher–Yates algorithm).
- **Difficulty levels** (Genin, Chunin, Jonin) that scale the number of cards and challenge.
- **Live API integration** to fetch Naruto characters dynamically.
- **Image validation** to handle missing or broken image URLs gracefully.
- **Persistent high score system** using localStorage.
- A polished **UI with TailwindCSS + Motion animations**, giving smooth hover and transition effects.

#### 🧠 Lessons Learned

- How to fetch and validate external API data efficiently.
- Proper use of `useEffect` for side effects and data fetching.
- Managing complex state changes in React (score, clicked IDs, win/loss logic).
- Building reusable UI components and handling game restarts cleanly.
- Writing maintainable and modular code that’s fun _and_ performs well.

#### 🥷 Tech Stack

- React 19
- Vite
- TailwindCSS 4
- Motion (Framer Motion for animations)
- Dattebayo API

### 💬 Reflection

These three days felt like a proper **Chunin Exam** — pushing both memory and coding endurance.  
By the end, I’d not only strengthened my understanding of React but also built something genuinely fun to play (and debug 😅).  
Flippuden turned out to be one of my favorite Odin Project builds so far — a perfect mix of logic, UI, and anime nostalgia.
